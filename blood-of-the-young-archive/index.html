					<img src="uploads/releases/049-spread.png" />

 					<p>Blood of the Young couldn't be happier to work with these talented fellows. With a slew of 7" releases just out or upcoming, on labels we love such as <a href="http://threeoneg.com/">Three.One.G</a>, <a href="https://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/">Joyful Noise</a>, and <a href="http://www.cobraside.com/catalog/">Cobraside</a>; as well as past full lengths on <a href="http://ipecac.com/">Ipecac</a>, Cobraside, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/heartchamp">Heart of a Champion</a>, these guys are prolific and we're honored to have been asked to release this 7". Official street date being 03/17, the day their tour starts in Brooklyn with <a href="http://sebadoh.com/">Sebadoh</a>, and continues long into April. Do <em>not</em> miss this tour, you'll be sorely disappointed!</p>

 					<p>Also, for you people in the twin cities; mark your calendars or clear what you've got on 04/03/15. Qui will be in town for a 7" release party / show at <a href="http://grumpys-bar.com/downtown.html">Grumpty's Downtown</a> with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/gaywitchabortionband">Gay Witch Abortion</a> and <a href="https://stnnng.bandcamp.com/">STNNNG</a>.

If you don't know what the "blood" editions are; think of a crazy label owner, some test pressings, and a razor blade. That's art, baby.</p>

					<h1>RIP Andrew Richardson</h1>

					<h2>September 5, 2014</h2>

					<img src="images/andy_1.jpg" />

					<p class="credit">Andrew Richardson, The Book of Dead Names tour</p>

					<p>You'll notice I'm falling apart. This update relates to the death of Andrew Richardson. He was on so many records on this label it's hard to count. Anyway, I normally hold my updates to a certain standard of non-insanity, i.e., they don't make me sound crazy. But this right here is literally the Blood of the Young... and I can't believe we lost him.</p>

 					<p>We lost a good one. Andy Richardson and I go back. Back to his old bands that pressed 7"s in high school and I thought it was so fucking amazing. He inspired me, a lot, to do the label. He showed me that it was possible. We went to the same high school, as did the Khayembii Communique guys, and my webmaster who is updating this right now, and so many of our friends and other scene people it's weird. So many of us go back to being teenagers.</p>

 					<p>Andy played guitar in The Crush, who did a 7", a full length, and a split 7" on Blood of the Young before getting signed to Billy Joe's <a href="http://adelinerecords.net/">Adeline Records</a> and putting out their second full length via Adeline. They did well and toured the damn UK with Green Day for fuck's sake. He was also in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheBookOfDeadNames">The Book of Dead Names</a>, who I thought would go on forever. But this time it really is the end. Though the second LP is close to done, and discussions among band members would seem to confirm we WILL finish this and get the few final tweaks Andy wanted done, and done the way he wanted them done. More to come on that.</p>

 					<p><a href="http://www.youcaring.com/memorial-fundraiser/memorial-for-andrew-richardson/228832">Please help out with the memorial fund if you can, it's to benefit his wife and 3 year old child, Bronson.</a></p>

 					<p>From everyone here at Blood of the Young (which, honestly, is really just a few people) we wish Moe and Bronson the best, and want them to know that they are in our thoughts. If the world wide web does stick around for a while, when you're older Bronson; just so you know your dad was pretty fucking cool. One of the coolest ever.</p>

					<h1>Tickle Torture EP</h1>

					<h2>July 8, 2014</h2>

					<p>Two days, two extremely exciting announcements.</p>

					<p>Blood of the Young is overjoyed to announce we will be bringing you the first physical <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tickletorturemusic">Tickle Torture</a> release. “Spectrophilia” [young-045 / young-045cd] is accompanied by the first, digital only Tickle Torture e.p. “Spiritual Machete“ as well. One package, one price, all sexy.</p>

					<p>If you've been living under a rock, who is Tickle Torture you ask?</p>

					<p>Tickle Torture is the sex-pop soundtrack for a new generation of freaks.  His first EP, “Spiritual Machete”  (2012), felt like catching Justin Timberlake and Prince making out in a dumpster full of broken synthesizers.  Equal parts electro-funk and sleaze, “Spectrophilia”  has further expanded this sound, incorporating the influences of trashy disco, post-Yeezus experimental hip-hop production sensibilities, and 80’s synth drenched R&amp;B classics to create a one-of-a-kind maximalist assault.   Feeding on the sweaty energy left from the funk dynasty of his home base in Minneapolis, one man producer, composer, engineer Elliott Kozel created these tracks over the course of the past year.  This do-everything-yourself aesthetic expands into every aspect of the project, from creating his own masks and costumes, to styling and producing many of his own music videos.  His sexual, chaotic live shows are half-party, half-performance art, and include a full live band, a team of backup dancers, an arsenal of confetti cannons, strobe lights and video projections.</p>

					<p>In the local scene, Tickle Torture has expanded into production work for some of Minneapolis’ finest talents, including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/goodnightsleeps">Caroline Smith</a> (with whom he co-wrote the nasty ”Fuck Me With The Lights On”) as well as the international rising star <a href="http://lizzomusic.com/">Lizzo</a>.  Album track “Ready for Love” features local R&amp;B luminary <a href="http://ashleydubose.com/">Ashley Dubose</a>, who recently reached a national audience via NBC’s The Voice, melding his experimental electronics and her Neo-Soul leanings into a slinky yet aggressive club banger.</p>

					<p>With this 5 song EP and 4 music videos set to launch this fall, Tickle Torture is poised to deliver his raw, sexual vision of the future of dance music.</p>

					<p>For now, enjoy the video for “Forgotten” off of “Spiritual Machete” and get ready for the first single and video from “Spectrophilia” to drop in the coming weeks. We'll make sure to let you know!</p>

					<h1>Celebrating 15 Years With 4 New Releases and a New Website!</h1>

					<h2>May 1, 2014</h2>

					<p>It’s been 15 years, today, since we first started dripping blood in the form of music, drained from the artists we’ve been lucky enough to work with over the years. A lot has happened in that time, and since being back (we came back the day the world was supposed to end, 12/21/12) we’ve dropped three releases we’re incredibly proud of: Croix Clayton’s novella <a href="releases.html#young-037">The Gate of Xibalba, or, The White Road</a> (young-037) , <a href="http://marijuanadeathsquads.com">Marijuana Deathsquads’</a> opus <a href="releases.html#young-038">The River</a> 12” (young-038), and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Blackthorne/392784997448359">Blackthorne’s</a> debut <a href="releases.html#young-039">Necroshark</a> 7” e.p. (young-039). We’re incredibly proud of all of these releases, and have more stuff headed your way. Up first, right now, available for free for 15 days to celebrate 15 years since the first release (The Khayembii Communique s/t 7”)…</p>

					<h3>Melting Wizard</h3>

					<img src="images/artists/croix.jpg" />

					<p>Meet Melting Wizard. Taste the first Melting Wizard track (young-042dl) for free, and help us celebrate.</p>

					<p style="margin-top: 1em"><iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="http://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/track=350786508/size=large/bgcol=333333/linkcol=cc0000/tracklist=false/artwork=small/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://croixclayton.bandcamp.com/track/melting-wizard">Melting Wizard by Croix Clayton</a></iframe></p> 

					<h3>Neighbors</h3>

					<img src="images/artists/neighbors.jpg" />

					<p>Next up, <a href="http://neighborsmusic.com/">Neighbors</a> are a killer band from Brooklyn, and you really ought to check them out. We’re doing the vinyl of their new album ‘<a href="releases.html#young-043">Failure</a>’ (young-043) released digitally on 03/25. Street date to be announced. To get an idea, here are the first two videos off of their new album:</p>

					<p>
						<a href="http://www.spin.com/articles/neighbors-wild-enough-video-failure-album/">Neighbors - “Wild Enough” Video (Spin)</a><br />
						<a href="http://www.stereogum.com/1674623/neighbors-last-of-a-kind-video-stereogum-premiere/video/">Neighbors – “Last Of A Kind” Video (Stereogum Premiere)</a>
					</p>

					<p>They’ve just charted #132 on the CMJ top 200 which is pretty cool.</p>

					<p>Post these two releases, two more are coming that are fleshed out enough we’ll mention them at this point:</p>

					<h3>Vi Som Älskade Varandra Så Mycket</h3>
	
					<img src="images/artists/vsavsm.jpg" />

					<p>VSAVSM — or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/visomalskade">Vi Som Älskade Varandra Så Mycket</a> — are an amazing hardcore band from Stockholm, Sweden. We are releasing their first LP, “<a href="releases.html#young-041">Den Sorgligaste Musiken I Världen</a>” (young-041). Ex-members of The Khayembii Comminuque, Song Of Zarathustra, Cardinal Sin, Ruh, Interlace, Neighbors, Speemarket Avenue, Young Team, and The Comedy.</p>

					<h3>L.I.V.</h3>

					<img src="images/artists/liv.jpg" />

					<p>Last, but most certainly not least, we have L.I.V., or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LiveInstructionalVideo">Live Instructional Video</a>. We’re doing their debut release, a cassette/DL entitled “Lazerjuice” (young-044cs.) These guys will entice you to get on their spaceship if you’re not careful.</p>

					<p>If you’re in the twin cities, don’t miss their Art-A-Whirl show, it’s going to be quite a show.</p>

					<p>Cheers, and here’s to 15 years of Blood. More releases are coming, and yes we will talk about them when we can. Oh and yes, there is most definitely a second <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheBookOfDeadNames">Book of Dead Names</a> LP coming. (young-040) We’ll let you know more on that when we can.</p>

					<h1><span class="title"><i>THE RIVER</i> &#8212; Marijuana Deathsquads</span> Streaming Now!</h1>

					<h2 class="meta">May 14, 2013 <span class="release-num">young-038d</span></h2>
					
					<p>
						<i>Marijuana Deathsquads</i> is the ever-evolving, experimental project lead by Ryan Olson, (producer/writer of <a href="http://www.thisispolica.com/">POLI&#199;A</a> and <a href="http://gayngs.net/">GAYNGS</a>), Isaac Gale, and Stefon Alexander (<a href="http://www.doomtree.net/p-o-s/">P.O.S</a>). With multiple drummers, a slew of electronic instruments, and highly effected vocals, their live shows are a violent onslaught of improvised yet tightly woven, jagged, intricate experimental sound. The band will be releasing two new E.P.s this month;  <i>Music Rocks 1 &amp; 2</i>, via <a href="http://totallygrossnationalproduct.com/">Totally Gross National Product</a>, at the end of a highly successful residency at the Icehouse in Minneapolis.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						&#8220;The River&#8221;&#8212;while released today for streaming so that it is available before this Friday&#8217;s performance of the piece at the third of five residency shows (at the aforementioned Icehouse)&#8212;will see a physical release in early fall. The physical 12&#8221; / digital release will see the light of day via Blood of the Young, and we couldn&#8217;t be more proud to say that the first new music from the label in a decade is from Marijuana Deathsquads. Dig it.

					<p>
						&#8220;The River&#8221; is based on a piece written for <a href="http://permanentadg.com/czeslaws-loop.php">Czeslaw's Loop</a>, a two day art installation on the Mississippi River that took place in North East Minneapolis in May, 2011. Marijuana Deathsquads performed as a 14 member band (7 drummers), in the rain, on a houseboat and homemade floating stage in the middle of the river. 
					</p>
 
					<p>
						Ryan and Isaac went down to the river and beat on pots and pans to try and figure out the tempo of the echoes on the river. Who knows if it was successful, but they figured it was 76bpms. (And Ryan now has one less pot, it having been destroyed via said beating.)

						Ryan Olson, Isaac Gale, Stef Alexander, Ben Ivascu, Freddy Votel, Drew Christopherson, Joe Christopherson, Ryan Olcott, Jesse Whitney, John Coe, Andy Fritz, Sean Hartman, Seth Rosetter, Varun Kataria, Mark McGee, Jason Power, Albert Elmore, Jeremy Nutzman.
