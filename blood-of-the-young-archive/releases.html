		<a href="#" class="buy-now">Buy Now</a>

		<p>Rifle Diet’s No Solace is a 12" 45 that combines the Classic Minneapolis crust sound with Swedish hardcore, D-beat and Epic crust (think somewhere between Servitude and Wolfbirgade, with hints of Tragedy and Fall of Efrafa). The beautiful cover art by Hannah Benoche sets a bleak mood for the dark music within, plus a cover of His Hero is a Gone – Chain of Command (ex-members of InDefence and Garmonbozia) This LP is a joint release between PROFANE EXISTENCE and BLOOD OF THE YOUNG RECORDS.</p>

		<p>Tickle Torture is the sex-pop soundtrack for a new generation of freaks. His first EP, “Spiritual Machete” (2012), felt like catching Justin Timberlake and Prince making out in a dumpster full of broken synthesizers. Equal parts electro-funk and sleaze, “Spectrophilia” has further expanded this sound, incorporating the influences of trashy disco, post-Yeezus experimental hip-hop production sensibilities, and 80’s synth drenched R&B classics to create a one-of-a-kind maximalist assault. Feeding on the sweaty energy left from the funk dynasty of his home base in Minneapolis, one man producer, composer, engineer Elliott Kozel created these tracks over the course of the past year. This do-everything-yourself aesthetic expands into every aspect of the project, from creating his own masks and costumes, to styling and producing many of his own music videos. His sexual, chaotic live shows are half-party, half-performance art, and include a full live band, a team of backup dancers, an arsenal of confetti cannons, strobe lights and video projections.</p>

		<p>In the local scene, Tickle Torture has expanded into production work for some of Minneapolis’ finest talents, including Caroline Smith (with whom he co-wrote the nasty ”Fuck Me With The Lights On”) as well as the international rising star Lizzo. Album track “Ready for Love” features local R&B luminary Ashley Dubose, who recently reached a national audience via NBC’s The Voice, melding his experimental electronics and her Neo-Soul leanings into a slinky yet aggressive club banger.</p>

		<p>With this 5 song EP, Tickle Torture is poised to deliver his raw, sexual vision of the future of dance music.</p>

					<a href="uploads/releases/043.jpg" class="cb" title="FAILURE - Neighbors"><img src="uploads/releases/043.jpg" /></a>

					<h3>FAILURE - Neighbors [LP]</h3>

					<h4>young-043</h4>

					<a href="#" class="buy-now">Buy Now</a>

					<p>Neighbors is the brainchild of Brooklyn-based songwriter Noah Stitelman. Collaborating with Philadelphia producer Kyle "Slick" Johnson (whose work includes albums by Modest Mouse, The Hives, and Rogue Wave), Neighbors released its debut full length, Good Luck, Kid, in the fall of 2012.</p>

					<p>Sort of  ‘80s UK New Wave, sort of ’90s Synth Pop — sort of neither — Good Luck, Kid tries to overcome the disappointments of everyday life in a storm of manic Manchester rhythms, eerie soundscapes, and deadpan humor.

					<p>Neighbors newest album, Failure, picks up this theme — and ties a stick of dynamite to it.

					<p>Do good fences make good neighbors? Stitelman doesn’t know. But with Failure, he might just bring a few down with him.</p>

					<h3>THE GATE OF XIBALBA, OR, THE WHITE ROAD — Croix Cambria Clayton</h3>

					<h4>young-037</h4>

					<a href="#" class="buy-now">Buy Now</a>

					<p>An experimental, non-linear narrative composed using Surrealist Automatic Writing techniques, and modeled on the 22 chapters of the Book Of Revelations of John (and the 22 major arcana of the tarot, on which Revelations itself was modeled), The Gate Of Xibalba is the absurdly visceral tale of millionaire playboy sociopath Christian Saxon- Banks, time-traveling golden boy of the White Road project, a secretive cabal of scientific, political, military and economic bigwigs bent on exploiting the geostrategic advantages of a rapidly emerging psychic high-technology, powered by human sacrifice.</p>

					<p><p class="quote">“Mining the psychic and mythological territory explored and devastated by William S. Burroughs, Diego De Landa, and even H.P. Lovecraft and Clark Ashton-Smith, Croix Clayton’s glittering cosmos of word-images is a calculated attempt to invent new directions for the genre called science fiction by removing the constraints of both space and time.”<br/>
					<br/>- V.Vale of Re/Search Publications</p></p>

					<p>Croix Cambria Clayton has been an active member of the Twin Cities creative arts community for over a decade. He has performed or displayed work at the Walker, Soap Factory, and Minneapolis Institute of Arts. As a musician he has played with The American Monsters, Thank You, and Young Quitters. He holds a BA in Film from the University of MN and this is his first novel.</p>

Tate also draws influence from the minimal sounds of Can and the dancy layers of "Low" era Eno/Bowie, creating an impact all it's own with simplistic yet powerful songs."</p>
